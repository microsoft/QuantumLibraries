## New to Quantum? ##

See the [introduction to quantum computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quantum-concepts-1-intro) provided with the Quantum Development Kit.

## Getting Started ##

The libraries provided in this repository are built using [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) and the
[Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/?view=qsharp-preview).
Please see the [installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quantum-installconfig) for how to get up and running.

You may also visit our [Quantum](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum) repository, which offers a wide variety
of samples on how to use these libraries to write quantum based programs.
