## Quantum and Iterative Phase Estimation ##

TODO: big strength is that we give a variety of phase estimation algs.

### Running the Sample ###

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set `Sample/PhaseEstimation/PhaseEstimationSample.csproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.

### Manifest ###

- `PhaseEstimation/`
  - `PhaseEstimationSample.csproj`: Main C# project for the example.
  - `Program.cs`: C# code to call the operations defined in Q♭.

### References ###

TODO: RPE, RWPE, RFPE, etc.

### TODO ###

- Currently all Q# code for this example is in the canon itself, due to multiproject restriction.
  Need to move code up into this project directly when that becomes possible.
