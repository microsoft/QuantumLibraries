    /// An element of the single-qubit Clifford group.
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// Each element is represented as as $E^{i} S^{j} X^{k} \omega^{\ell}$, where $\omega^8 = 1$ and where $E = H S^3 \omega^3$.

    /// # Named Items
    /// ## E
    /// The power to which $E$ should be raised to generate this element.
    /// ## S
    /// The power to which $S$ should be raised to generate this element.
    /// ## X
    /// The power to which $X$ should be raised to generate this element.
    /// ## Omega
    /// The power to which $\omega$ should be raised to generate this element.
    ///
    /// # Example
